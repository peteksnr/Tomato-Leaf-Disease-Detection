# Tomato Leaf Disease Detection

## 🌱 Introduction

Agriculture plays a crucial role in sustaining society, providing food and resources worldwide. However, plant diseases pose a significant challenge by affecting the quality and yield of crops, often leading to substantial economic losses. Early detection and treatment are critical to minimizing damage, but traditional methods, which rely on expert visual inspections, are often time-consuming and impractical for large-scale farming operations.

Tomato plants, in particular, are susceptible to various diseases, such as **early blight**, **late blight**, and **bacterial spot**, caused by bacteria and fungi. Detecting these diseases early can significantly enhance crop productivity and reduce losses.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project focuses on the development and application of a **deep convolutional neural network (CNN)** to detect tomato leaf diseases effectively.

### ✨ Key Features:
- **Dataset**: A public dataset containing **11,102 images** of healthy and diseased plant leaves collected under controlled conditions, filtered for tomato-specific images.
- **Model**: A CNN-based model trained to classify tomato leaves as healthy or affected by specific diseases.
- **Goal**: Provide a practical, automated solution for detecting tomato crop diseases to assist farmers in managing their crops more effectively.
